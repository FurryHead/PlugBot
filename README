PlugBot is compiled with the following:

    GCC version 4.4.3
    Lua 5.1.4 - http://lua.org/
    Sockets 2.3.9.5 - http://www.alhem.net/Sockets/index.html
    Linux! :)

I will also be hosting copies of the specific versions of Lua and Sockets
on my homepage for PlugBot once it's created, in the case that either
these specific versions become unavailable, or the project's homepage disappears.

INSTALLING / COMPILING
As I have neither a Mac or Windows computer, this has been tested only on linux.
If you would like to help test / develop PlugBot, and you have a Mac and/or Windows
computer(s), I would greatly appreciate the help.

If you're not running linux, you'll have to edit the makefile and adjust these commands accordingly.

Assuming you've installed Sockets already, "Sockets-config" should be in your path (accessible by make)

cd PlugBot
make
./plugbot --makeconf
./plugbot

And you're done! :) Have fun!
